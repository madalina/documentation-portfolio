# Samples of technical writing

I would love to be able to share some of the internal technical documentation and software release notes with you, but unfortunately, they are not in the public domain. However, I can share a couple of working samples of documentation work that I've done on open source projects, as well as individual snippets.

## Samples of REST API documentation
1. Node REST API for a blog (open source collaboration, ongoing):
   - [Swagger UI](https://stark-brushlands-58685.herokuapp.com/api/v1/?fbclid=IwAR0o2XF4g0WLvmdc_3mahMy4f9IjZb1l2cYIROoz_SGRwJdogrI1Z2_Ld3A) for the REST API
   - [README.md file](https://github.com/madalina/node-rest-api) for contextual documentation
